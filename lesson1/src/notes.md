## üìù Introduction: What is a Spring Bean?

A **Spring Bean** is just a Java object that is managed by the **Spring Framework**.

Spring keeps track of certain objects and automatically **creates**, **shares**, and **connects** them for you. These managed objects are called *beans*.

> Imagine asking Spring:  
> *‚ÄúHey Spring, I need this class ‚Äî can you give it to me?‚Äù*  
> Spring replies:  
> *‚ÄúSure! I already created it, and I‚Äôll inject it wherever you need.‚Äù*

## üß± `@Component`: Mark a Class as a Spring Bean

Use `@Component` to tell Spring:

> ‚ÄúPlease manage this class as a bean.‚Äù

```java

@Component
public class HelloComponent {
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello from HelloComponent!";
    }
}

```
When Spring starts, it finds all classes annotated with `@Component` and keeps them ready to use.

## ü§ù `@Autowired`: Ask Spring for a Bean

Use `@Autowired` to tell Spring:

> ‚ÄúGive me the bean for this class.‚Äù

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/hello")
public class HelloController {

    @Autowired
    private HelloComponent helloComponent;

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String sayHello() {
        return helloComponent.sayHello();
    }
}
```
When someone accesses `/hello`, Spring injects an instance of `HelloComponent` and calls its method.

## üåê `@RestController`: Create a Web Endpoint

Use `@RestController` to tell Spring:

> ‚ÄúThis class handles web requests and returns data (not HTML).‚Äù

A `@RestController` combines:
- `@Controller` (makes it a Spring MVC controller)
- `@ResponseBody` (returns data like JSON or text, not views)

So if your method returns `"Hello"` ‚Äî the browser will **display it directly**, not look for an HTML file.

---

## üîó `@RequestMapping`: Handle HTTP Routes

Use `@RequestMapping` to tell Spring:

> ‚ÄúWhen someone visits this URL, run this method.‚Äù

### Example:

```java
@RequestMapping("/hello")
public String sayHello() {
    return "Hi!";
}
```

Now visiting `http://localhost:8080/hello` will run the method and return `"Hi!"` in the browser.

## üìå Summary

| Annotation         | Meaning                                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Component`       | Register the class as a Spring Bean                           |
| `@Autowired`       | Inject an existing bean into this class                       |
| `@RestController`  | A controller that returns data (usually JSON or plain text)   |
| `@RequestMapping`  | Connects a URL path (like `/hello`) to a method               |
